    <h1>BostonHacks Junkathon</h1>
    <h2>Putting the Wackathon in Hackathon</h2>

    <p>On 4/13 we will be programming poor ideas in the BUild Lab. You should too. No experience necessary and everyone is welcome.</p>
    <h2>The rules:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No taking yourself seriously</li>
      <li>Must laught at least once an hour; if not, you may be kicked out</li>
      <li>10 hours to build your worst project possible</li>
      <li><del>Impress the sponsors</del><sub>(there won't be any)</sub></li>
      <li>There will probably be swag</li>
      <li>There will definitely be food</li>
      <li>Everyone helps each other build something useless</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Good ideas for a project include:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A reverse ad blocker that blocks everything except ads</li>
      <li>A twitter bot that publicly tweets every website you visit</li>
      <li>An app that will unfollow all your poor friends so you can work your way up into the capitalist elite.</li>
      <li>If you have a good idea for us to put on this site type it here and we might add it: But your ideas are probably terrible! (Geez, this website is hurtful.)<input /></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>If you've made it this far you should definitely come (Did we mention there will be food?)</h2>
