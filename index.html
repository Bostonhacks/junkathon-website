    <h1>BostonHacks Junkathon</h1>
    <h2>Putting the hack back in hackathon</h2>

    <p>On 4/13 we will be programming some very bad ideas in the Build Lab. Please join us. No experience necessary and everyone is welcome.</p>
    <h2>The rules:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No taking yourself seriously</li>
      <li>10 hours to build a terrible project</li>
      <li>Do not impress any sponsors (there won't be any)</li>
      <li>There will probably be swag</li>
      <li>There will definitely be food</li>
      <li>Everyone helps each other build something useless</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Good ideas for a project include:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A reverse ad blocker that blocks everything except ads</li>
      <li>A twitter bot that publicly tweets every website you visit</li>
      <li>If you have a good idea for us to put on this site type it here and we might add it: <input /></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>If you've made it this far you should definitely come</h2>
